# eGov Testing Machine Manual

## About the project
The Autonomous Province of Bolzano currently offers important digital
services (for eg, online applications to start businesses, pay
property taxes and initiate e-Payments etc), the number is expected to
increase as eGoverment services continue to grow.

The FSCRS project intends to contribute to the creation and
improvement of eGovernment services through an innovative process that
verifies and tests functionality. The underlying idea of the project
is that the accessibility of digital public services is necessary to
increase the innovation potential of the region. .

The project takes its name from the Free Software Client Reference
System, a specific reference system (OS + defined set of software
applications) that during testing simulates a user accessing the
services.

## About the software

Testingmachine is used to test eGovernment services.  The eGovernment
services can vary from country to country but generally it grants
citizens access to important documents and information. In most EU
countries there are additional services like paying property tax that
can be done online. Most governments in Europe are leaning in this
direction in order to decrease administrative overhead.

Another challenge to overcome will be testing eGov services on mobile
platforms, more specifially automating tests under Android.  Good news
is this is possible using Selenium. The one major obstacle that we
face is getting around the smart card login. So far I am unaware of
getting this to work under Android unless you patch the kernel and
this is of course no an option. More documentation and research is
needed concerning this.


## The eGov Testing Machine

The expected result is the development of a systematic, auto
validation process, currently not available on the market, which
allows the testing of eGovernment services without the manual
intervention of an operator

The eGov Testing Machine can be thought of as a virtual group of
people, sitting at the computer and using the eGov services and
checking if they work properly, allowing the local Public
Administration to test eGov services on a daily basis that are being
offered to all citizens.

## Software Overview

The Testing Machine is currently made up by Virtual Machine Manager
(tm-vmm) and documentation on how to wite, execute and automate tests
of eGov sites in particular but also other softwares.

### Virtual Machine Manager (VMM)

tm-vmm is made up by bash scripts that let the user manage various
virtual machine software in a general way. See the tm-vmm manual for
more information.

### eGov Manuals

Writing tests of eGov sites is not hard but we believe that some help
will still be useful for most people. The manuals and guides provided
together with tm-vmm make it possible to test eGov sites automatically
and unattended.

# Installation 

##  Software requirement
 
* ssh (client)

* at least one virtualization software (see list of supported softwares below)

* bash

## Supported Virtualization software

* Virtualbox

* qemu

We're looking into supporting: vmware, 

## Downloading Virtual Machine Manager

### Via git

* Download git code

  `git clone git://github.com/tis-innovation-park/vvm.git`

### Via a dist file (.tar.gz)

 Coming later

## Building and installing Virtual Machine Manager

* Go to the vvm directory

  `cd vvm`

* Configure the software

  `./configure --prefix <installationdir>`

* Build the software

  `make`

* Install the software

  `sudo make install`

* Verify the installation

  `<installationdir>/bin/tm-vmm --list-clients`






## Setup 

* Create the directory $HOME/.testingmachine

  `mkdir $HOME/.testingmachine`

* Create tm-vmm.conf in .testingmachine, typically with your favorite editor (emacs?)

  `emacs ~/.testingmachine/tm-vmm.conf`

In this file you can configure settings you want to use as default in
your clients. It is perfectly possible to override these settings in
your individual client configurations.

For a list of variables, see section Configuration syntax below.

## Creating a machine

To create a machine vvm relies on the virtualization software. So if
you want to manage a Virtualbox machine you (at least for now) create
it with Virtualbox. For information about how to do this, read the
chapter "Creating a Virtualbox machine".


## Creating a client

First of all you need to decide what machine you want to use with your client. In the example below we will assume it is called Debian6.0


* Create a directory for all clients:

  `mkdir ~/.testingmachine/clients`

## Create a client configuration

You can create client configuration in two different ways:

* Manually create a configuration file for the client (using a virtual machine):

      [CLIENT NAME].conf

    * Set the variables as you find suitable for your project.

* Use the command line option:

    `--create-client-conf`

Example usage of the option.

    `tm-vmm --create-client-conf  Debian-6.0`

## Example of a client configuration:


`   VM_NAME=Debian6.0`
`   VM_TYPE="VirtualBox"`
`   VM_IP_ADDRESS=192.168.1.2`
`   VM_USER=$USER`
`   VM_SUPERUSER=root`
`   SSH_PORT=22`
`   SSH_SHUTDOWN_COMMAND="shutdown -h now"`

For more variables see section Configuration syntax below

* Copy the public ssh key to the machine, e.g

  `ssh-copy-id 192.168.1.2`



# Using Virtual Machine Manager

Regardless of the underlying virtual machine you manage the machine in
one way. We provide the most basic uses of tm-vmm here and encourage you
to read the complete list of command line options in the last section
of the manual.

## Starting

### Starting with guest operating system visible

`tm-vmm --start-client <CLIENTNAME>`

Example:

`tm-vmm --start-client Ubuntu-10`

### Starting without showing guest operating system (headless)

`tm-vmm --start-client-headless <CLIENTNAME>`

Example:

`tm-vmm --start-client-headless Ubuntu-10`

## Checking status

`tm-vmm --check-client-status <CLIENTNAME>`

Example:

`tm-vmm --check-client-status Ubuntu-10`

## Stopping

`tm-vmm --stop-client <CLIENTNAME>`

Example:

`tm-vmm --stop-client Ubuntu-10`

# Selenium

## About Selenium

*Selenium is a portable software testing framework for web
 applications. Selenium provides a record/playback tool for authoring
 tests without learning a test scripting language (Selenium IDE). It
 also provides a test domain-specific language (Selenese) [1] to write
 tests in a number of popular programming languages, including Java,
 C#, Groovy, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby. The tests can then be run
 against most modern web browsers. Selenium deploys on Windows, Linux,
 and Macintosh platforms.*

This text is quoted from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenium_(software)

Selenium is run on the guest so some tweaks are needed to get things
working, but don't worry we've done almost everything for you.

## Writing Selenium tests

Selenium tests can be easily created by installing one of the plugins for various browsers.
To use Selenium in Firefox simply download the plugin which at the time of writing is at V2.0.0
`release.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/2.0.0/selenium-ide-2.0.0.xpi`

Once installed and started Selenium starts recording actions that the user is doing in the browser.
You can now start clicking through the webpage and Selenium records all actions that can be replayed
later.

To make sure the correct pages with the correct text is showing you can right click on a certain area
of the webpage and verify if the text is actually present. This way you can 'test' the page and make sure
it is behaving as intended.

A simple test could look like the following:

`<tr>
	<td>open</td>
	<td>/de/dienste/dienste-az.asp</td>
	<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>clickAndWait</td>
	<td>link=Abendschulen</td>
	<td></td>

Please not this is barely scraping the surface of what Selenium can do and is by no means a complete "How-To". Far from it.

## Problems we've encountered 

### Logging in to a web site using a smart card

When setting up the Testingmachine in South Tyrol to test the *burger
card* the biggest obstacle we had to overcome was the login
process. Since this is done using a smart card and a pin we found no
way to do this using Selenium and so Sikuli was used.  Once logged in,
Selenium can be used to test the web services.

Getting Sikuli to perform an automatic login can be done in the following way:

## Sikuli

In order to use Sikuli a test case has to be made. This is done within
Sikuli to emulate the login process step by step.  A possible test
case could look like this:

```python
wait("KJ2.png",60)
click("1352889207953.png")
sleep(5)
wait("Pleaseentert.png",60)
click("Pleaseentert-1.png")
type("96414648")
sleep(1)
click("OK.png")
sleep(2)
wait("Thlssltehasr.png",60)
click("1352890307684.png")
sleep(2)
wait("Tl2fIlHlKJlI.png",60)
```

The .png files are created with Sikuli. When running Sikuli you can
take 'snapshots' of certain parts of the screen that are captured and
later used as a reference point where to perform certain functions
like emulating button presses or entering text. Sikuli then 'looks'
for parts of the screen that matches the 'snapshots' before it
performs actions. This works well with web pages since Sikuli can wait
until a page has loaded before executing a command.

**Note:** *We've also written some words on how to setup smart cards. See *


# Creating virtual machines

## Creating a VirtualBox machine with Ubuntu 12.10 

Basically you should follow the normal procedure, as described in the
VirtualBox manual, on how to create a new virtual machine. However we
provide a guide below to make this easier. You can choose to use our
settings or change some at your will.

**Note:** *If you’re on a Ubuntu system you might have to add your user to the vboxusers group.*

### Name and operating system

* Name:	    eGov testing machine
* Type:	    Linux
* Version:  Ubuntu (64 bit)

![Name and os] (screenshots/name-and-operating-system.png "Name and operating system")



### Memory size

* 2048 MB

![Memory size](screenshots/memory-size.png)


### Hard drive

* Choose to create a virtual hard drive now

![Hard drive](screenshots/hard-drive.png)

### Hard drive file type

* Choose VDI 

![Hard drive file type](screenshots/hard-drive-file-type.png)

### Storage on physical hard drive

* Choose Dynamically allocated

![Hard drive file type](screenshots/storage-on-physical-hard-disk.png)


### File location and size

* 8 GB should be enough

![File location and size](screenshots/file-location-and-size.png)


Your disk has now been created. Before starting it we need to do some additional settings.

### Network

#### Setup the network card

* Open up the VirtualBox Manager
* Choose your Virtual machine and click Settings
* Make sure Network Adapter 1 is enabled. 

The following settings should be applied to Adapter 1.

**Attached to**:  NAT (previously Bridged adaptor was advised)

* **Name**:       eth0
* **Advanced**:     
* **Adapter type**:		Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (...)
* **Promiscuous mode**: 	Deny
* **MAC Address**:		use the suggested
* **Cable connected**:		should be checked

*This gives your virtual machine an IP address on the same subnet as
 the host computer. See http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ Chapter 6
 for additional information on bridged networking.*

![Network](screenshots/network-1.png)



##### Allowing SSH logins to your virtual machine

Open up the VirtualBox Manager

Choose your Virtual machine and click Settings

Choose Port forwarding

Add a new rule by clicking the + sign. Enter

* **Rule**: ssh
* **Protocol**: TCP
* **Host IP**:
* **Host Port**: 2256   (the value can basically be any free port on your host computer)
* **Guest IP**:
* **Guest Port**: 22

![Network](screenshots/network-port-forward.png)

#### USB
Make sure USB is enabled if you plan to use a smart card reader or another USB device 


To use a smart card reader in your virtual machine you have to do the following:

* Attach the smart card reader to your computer
* Add Filter from Device (Alt + Ins) and choose the device that is attached to the physical machine. 
* The same procedure applies to other peripherals, like a USB storage device.

See http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ Chapter 3 for additional information

### Installing Ubuntu

Download the preferred Ubuntu iso image from ubuntu.com

Click Settings and choose storage. 

Add the downloaded iso image to the virtual machine as a CD-ROM by clicking the Empty icon (image missing) under Controller: IDE and then click on the disc icon right of the text CD/DVD Drive: . 

![Storage](screenshots/storage-pre.png)


Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file ... and point out the downloaded iso image (e.g. ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso).

![Storage](screenshots/storage-post.png)

Click Start

Follow the installation instructions to install Ubuntu in your new virtual machine.

#### Upgrading your installation

To upgrade your system you need to:

* Click on the Software updater icon to your left
* Click install now
* Enter password



#### Installing necessary tools in your virtual machine

The following tools need to be installed on your virtual machine

* openssh-server

Install them by typing the following command in a terminal window,
assuming you’re logged in as your first user (created during the
Ubuntu installation):

sudo apt-get install openssh-server


#### Setting up users on the virtual machine

Log in to your virtual machine as the user you created during installation.

##### Setting up the root account

* Permit root to login via the ssh server.
* Launch a terminal window 
* Open up the ssh server configuration file

`sudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config` 

* Make sure that PermitRootLogin is set to yes
* Restart the ssh server

`sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart ` 

* Add the ssh key of your host user to the root account



TODO: what IP does the client/guest get??

##### Setting up a new user

VMM puts no restrictions or requirements on the name of the user in your virtual machine. The user name “egov-tester” is given here as an example and will be used in all manual text below.

Log in as the user you created during the Ubuntu installation.

Open up a user management tool by pressing the dasher (logo missing) and type user accounts. 

* Press the unlock symbol and type in the password of the first user you created. 

* Press the + symbol. You will now see a new window, called Create new account, in which you should fill in:

**Account Type**:	      Standard
**Full name**:		E-goc tester
**Username**		      egov

* Click on Enable password and type in a password.

# Example use:

/opt/bin/tm-vmm --check-client-status Ubuntu-12.10

/opt/bin/tm-vmm --check-client-status Ubuntu-12.10

/opt/bin/tm-vmm --check-client-ssh    Ubuntu-12.10

/opt/bin/tm-vmm --client-exec         Ubuntu-12.10 "pkcs15-tool -L"

# Testing Machine VMM configuration

## Configuration file syntax

The syntax for setting a variable is the same as in bash scrips (no coincidence!). Basically you write:

`VARIABLE=VALUE`

### Variables 

`LOG_FILE_DIR=/tmp/vmm/log` - sets the log file base directory to /tmp/vmm/log. This means that all logs can be found here.

`VM_STARTUP_TIMEOUT=10` - the time to wait for a virtual machine to start up before considering it to be 'dead'.

`VM_STOP_TIMEOUT=20` - the time to wait for a virtual machine to start up before taking more drastic actions to take down the machine. Ultimately VVM will take down a machine with a `kill`.

`SSH=ssh` - the SSH program to use

`SSH_TEST_OPTIONS=" -o connectTimeout=3"` - the options to pass to the SSH program (see SSH variable above) when testing of the machine is up (or not).

`VM_NAME="Debian6.0"` - the name of the machine to use in this client. It is important that your Virtualization software can find this machine.

`VM_TYPE="VirtualBox"` - what type of Virtulization software this machine belongs to. Currently you can use: VirtualBox and qemu

`VM_IP_ADDRESS=192.168.x.x` - the IP address of the virtual machine 

`VM_USER=$USER` - the user you want to use when accessing the virtual machine

`VM_SUPERUSER=root` - the name of the super user/administrator account, typically used to reboot the machine 

`SSH_PORT=22` - the port where the SSH server is running on the client

`SSH_SHUTDOWN_COMMAND="shutdown -h now"` - VVM will do its very best to shut down a machine as gracefully as possible. One way to do this is to try to shut it down using SSH. The command in this variable will be used to do that.
